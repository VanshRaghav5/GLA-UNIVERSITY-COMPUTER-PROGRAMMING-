A list is a data structure that is a mutable r changeable ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.Just as strings are defined as characters
between quotes lists are defined by having values between square brackets[].
Example of List- look at a simple list that stores several names of dog breeds: dog_breeds= ['corgi','labrador','poodle','jack russel']
print(dog_breeds)
in the first line we use square brackets to create a list that contains four elements and then assign it to the dog_breeds variable
in the second line the list is printed through the variable's name.All the elements are printed in the same order as they were stored in the list because lists are ordered.
Here is another list that contains five integer:
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(numbers)
