There are two ways in which list is mutable:
1st- item assignment
2nd- item deletion 
if we are able to do these operations with an element then the element is mutable otherwise not.

1st - Item Assignment
t="hello"
st[0]="H"
print(st)
st = [3, 5, 6]
print('before operation', id(st))
st[0] = 'H'
print('after operation', id(st))"""  #id will be the same because the list is immutable
print(st)

2nd - Item Deletion
a=10
print(a)
del a  # 'del'   deletes item
print(a**2)
st=[3,5,6]
print(st, "before operation", id(st))
del st[0] # it will delete the first item of st which is 3
print(st, "after operation", id(st)
